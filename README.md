Your name is Flynn. You're a game developer at Nort Games, a company that specializes in virtual reality experiences.
You're putting on the finishing touches to your company's latest, sure-to-be hit: World of <>. 
It's late at night and you're the only person in the office. You hit Build, don your VR helmet, and get ready to test it.
Suddenly, the power goes off. It's pitch black; you can't see anything. 
You go to remove your helmet and fumble for the light switch, but you can't seem to get the helmet off.
As you start to freak out, your VR headset turns on. You see a long hallway straight in front of you, and other hallways branching off.
You hear a distant voice: 'My name is Grue! If you want to escape this place, you must navigate my mazes!'

For this week's problem, the input text files store a 'map' of the maze, like this:

```
--Sx
-xxF
----
```

S is your starting point. F is the exit. Dashes are 'open' spaces, while X's or x's are walls.
Your program must read in the map, do work, and then output a list of moves to navigate to the exit.
For example, for the above maze,  your program should output:

```
WWSSEEEN
```

corresponding to the cardinal directions (N = north, E = east, etc).

Work fast to avoid being eaten by the Grue!
